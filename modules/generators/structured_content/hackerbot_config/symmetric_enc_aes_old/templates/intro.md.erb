# Symmetric Encryption with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

## Getting started
### VMs in this lab

==Start these VMs== (if you haven't already):
- hackerbot_server (leave it running, you don't log into this)
- desktop

### Your login details for the "desktop" VM
User: <%= $main_user %>
Password: tiaspbiqe2r (**t**his **i**s **a** **s**ecure **p**assword **b**ut **i**s **q**uite **e**asy **2** **r**emember)

You won't login to the hackerbot_server, but the VM needs to be running to complete the lab.

### For marks in the module
1. **You need to submit flags**. Note that the flags and the challenges in your VMs are different to other's in the class. Flags will be revealed to you as you complete challenges throughout the module. Flags look like this: ==flag{*somethingrandom*}==. Submit your flags in Hacktivity to register your progress in the lab.

## Meet Hackerbot!

This exercise involves Hackerbot, a chatbot who will interact with you and your system. If you satisfy Hackerbot by completing the challenges she will reveal flags to you.

**On the desktop VM:**

==Open Pidgin and send some messages to Hackerbot:==

- Try asking Hackerbot some questions
- Send "help"
- Send "list"
- Send "hello"

Work through the following exercises, completing the Hackerbot challenges as noted.
