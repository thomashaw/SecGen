## Recap: Encoding vs Encryption

Encoding and encryption are two types of process used within cyber security and computing more broadly in order to transform data from one format into another.

*Encoding* involves converting data from one format into another using a pre-defined scheme, generally for compatability or representational purposes. Examples include: converting binary data into hexadecimal, representing raw binary data as printable strings (ASCII, Unicode), or encoding binary data with non-printable characters into base64 or URL encoding formats.

*Encryption* similarly involves converting the data into another format using a pre-defined scheme, but the schemes aim to securely hide the data from 3rd parties. Encrypting a message with an encryption algorithm involves a secret key to encrypt the message into ciphertext. Examples of encryption algorithms include AES (symmetric-key cryptography) and RSA (asymmetric-key, aka public-key cryptography).

The key distinction between the two is that encryption aims to transform the data into a confidential format, where encoding does not.

There are two main categories of encryption algorithm: symmetric-key cryptography, which uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data, and asymmetric-key (or public-key) cryptography which uses a pair of keys, one for encrypting and another for decrypting.
This lab introduces symmetric-key cryptography using the AES algorithm.
