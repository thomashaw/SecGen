## Recap: Encoding vs Encryption

Encoding and encryption are two types of process used within cyber security and computing more broadly in order to transform data from one format into another.

*Encoding* involves converting data from one format into another using a pre-defined scheme, generally for compatibility or representational reasons.

*Encryption* similarly involves converting the data into another format using a pre-defined scheme, but the schemes aim to securely hide the data from 3rd parties. Encrypting a message with an encryption algorithm involves a secret key to encrypt the message into ciphertext. Examples of encryption algorithms include AES (symmetric-key cryptography) and RSA (asymmetric-key, aka public-key cryptography).

The key distinction between the two is that encryption aims to transform the data into a confidential format, where encoding does not.

### Encoding

Encoding can be viewed as translating data from one format to another.
Computers fundamentally operate using high and low electric charges, which are represented in binary as '1' and '0'.
Early computers were programmed with binary systems using punch cards, where a punched hole may represent one operation and no hole represented another.

Examples include:
- Representing raw binary data in a more human-friendly format
-- e.g. Using Hexadecimal instead of Binary within low-level
- Representing raw binary data as printable text strings (e.g. [ASCII](https://www.asciitable.com/) and [Unicode]()).
-- e.g. In ASCII the character 'A' is mapped to the 8-bit binary (base 2) value '01000001', which is '65' in decimal (base 10), and '41' in hexadecimal (base 16).
- encoding binary data with non-printable characters into base64 or URL encoding formats.
- converting raw binary data into hexadecimal (e.g. Decimal 15 in Binary is 1111 and in Hexadecimal is F)

There are two main categories of encryption algorithm: symmetric-key cryptography, which uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data, and asymmetric-key (or public-key) cryptography which uses a pair of keys, one for encrypting and another for decrypting.
This lab introduces symmetric-key cryptography using the AES algorithm.
