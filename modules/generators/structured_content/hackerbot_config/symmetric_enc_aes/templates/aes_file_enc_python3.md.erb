## File encryption using AES and python3

We will encrypt /etc/hosts file using python3 and the Cryptodome module. Feel free to use any other file.

Open the python3 REPL in your terminal.

`python3`

Import the required modules[^8]

```python3
>>> from Cryptodome.Cipher import AES
>>> from Cryptodome.Util.Padding import pad, unpad
```

Open and read from the /etc/hosts file

```python3
>>> with open("/etc/hosts", "rb") as f:
...   file = f.read()
...
>>>
```

You can generate random key using this command in a bash shell:

`head -c16 /dev/random | xxd -ps`

where -c16 is the number of bytes we're reading from the /dev/random pseudorandom number generator using the head command. The raw data is passed to xxd which represents it in hexadecimal.

Now let's encrypt the /etc/hosts file, please note that the key is randomly generated using the command above.


```python3
>>> key = b"71830edfe47b1b808af76fb62114b349"
>>> e = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC)
>>> c = e.encrypt(pad(file,16))
```

You can inspect the contents of the ciphertext

`>>> print(c)`

To write data to a file, open the file in *w*rite *b*inary mode
```python3
>>> with open("/home/<%= $main_user %>/hosts.enc", "wb") as f:
...   f.write(c)
...
>>>
```

To decrypt...


```python3
>>> d = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC)
>>> getMsg = d.decrypt(c)
>>> print(unpad(getMsg,16))
```

[^8]: The pad and unpad functions are needed for ECB and/or CBC mode(s)
