## AES using GPG

Create a file and name it msg.txt using the following command:

```bash
echo '"Science does not aim at establishing immutable truths and eternal dogmas; its aim is to approach the truth by successive approximations, without claiming that at any stage final and complete accuracy has been achieved." - Bertrand Russell' > msg.txt
```

TODO: Review this is doing what it looks like, why do we need the public key pair here?

Generate a pair of keys (public and private)

```bash
gpg --gen-key
```

Encrypt msg.txt producing ciphertext as output (msg.enc)

```bash
gpg -o msg.enc -s --cipher-algo AES128 msg.txt
```

Decrypt msg.enc and redirect the plaintext output to msg.txt-decrypted

```bash
gpg -o msg.txt-decrypted -d msg.enc
```
