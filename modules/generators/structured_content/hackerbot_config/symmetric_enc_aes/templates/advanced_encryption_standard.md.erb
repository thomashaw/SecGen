# Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

AES is a block cipher based on a symmetric key cryptosystem and it is an iterated cipher (up to 14 rounds of iteration, based on the key size). It uses key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits. However, it operates on a block size of 128-bit.


## AES: A High Level Description

This is a basic description of AES (Stinson and Paterson, 2019).

1. Given a message (plaintext) *m*, initialise **State**[^1] to be *m*, add Round Key[^2] (**ROUNDKEY**), then XOR it with **State**.

2. For each N - 1 rounds, do a substitution operation (**SUBBYTES**)[^3] on **State** using pre-defined s-box (substitution-box); then perform permutation using (**SHIFTROWS**)[^4] followed by (**MIXCOLUMNS**)[^5] on **State** and then add (**ROUNDKEY**).

3. On the last round perform all of the operations in stage 2 **except** the **MIXCOLUMNS** operation.

4. Generate the ciphertext *y*


[^1]: In AES State is a 4x4 matrix
[^2]: Individual Round Keys are generated for each round of encryption, based on the encryption key using a key schedule AES uses the four transformations above.
[^3]: The SubBytes transformation replaces the values in State with other values, making use of the Rijnadel S-box (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael_S-box).
[^4]: The ShiftRows transformation shifts the data in the rows 4x4 state matrix based on an offset. (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#The_ShiftRows_step).
[^5]: The MixColumns transformation switches the values of the columns in the 4x4 state matrix using matrix multiplication (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael_MixColumns).
