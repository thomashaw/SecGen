==Complete the following Log Book task:==

Encryption/decryption techniques are methods that help with confusion and diffusion in a cryptosystem.
You may highlight the mathematics behind the reviewed algorithms/cipher if you would like to do so;
however, this is not required unless necessary as part of your discussion/review.
A) The Security of RSA cryptosystem.
B) Diffie-Hellman algorithm and its security.


### Requirements for Log Book Task
1. Provide a clear explanation of the reviewed cipher/algorithm (how it works).
2. Include illustrations, flow charts, digrams to underpin your arguments.
3. Critically evaluate the cipher/algorithm (strengths, weaknesses, efficiency, etc..).
4. Cryptanalysis techniques against the given cipher/algorithm.
