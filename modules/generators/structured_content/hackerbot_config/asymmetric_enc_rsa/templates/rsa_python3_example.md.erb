# An example of RSA using Python3

In this example we will go through the following steps:

- Pick 2 prime numbers, *p* and *q*
- Calculate *N*
- Calculate *phi(N)*
- Select exponent *e* (used for encryption)
- Select *d* (used for decryption)

From your Linux shell prompt open the python3 REPL to begin:
`python3`

### Pick 2 prime numbers p and q

```
>>> p = 7
>>> q = 23
```

### Calculate N
```
>>> N = p * q
```

### Calculate phi(N)
```
>>> phiN = (p-1)*(q-1)
>>> print(p, q, N, phiN)
```

So far we have calculated: *p* = 7, *q* = 23, *N* = 161 and *phiN* = 132

### Find e (exponent / encryption key / public key)

- *e* must be between 1 and 132 (1 and *phi(N)*)
- Also, *e* must be a co-prime with *n* and *phi(N)*

1. Check all of the numbers in the ring (1-132), once the above conditions are met, select *e*
2. Let's keep it simple and choose 5 as e (as it satisfies both conditions)
3. For this example, the public key (e, N) is (5, 161)

### Find d (decryption key / private key)

- *d* must satisfy this condition (*d*.*e*) mod phi(N) = 1
- *d* will always be within the 1-132 ring of integers

To find the decryption key, multiply each number of the ring (modulo 132) until you reach 1

- Such that (d * 5) mod 132 = 1

Let's select *d* as 53

- Such that d = 53

(53 * 5) % 132 = 1


### Encryption

RSA works using numbers, so let's find the integer representation of this message: "The Hobbit"

Python's built in ord() function takes in a character as an argument and returns the integer that represents the character in [ASCII](https://www.rapidtables.com/code/text/ascii-table.html).

e.g. ord('Z') will return 90.

```
>>> ord('T')
>>> ord('h')
>>> ord('e')
>>> ord('')
>>> ord('H')
>>> ord('o')
>>> ord('b')
>>> ord('i')
>>> ord('t')
>>> ord('t')
*** 84 104 101 32 72 111 98 105 116 116 ***
(84 ** e) % N
(104 ** e) % N
(101 ** e) % N
(32 ** e) % N
(72 ** e) % N
(111 ** e) % N
(98 ** e) % N
(105 ** e) % N
(116 ** e) % N
(116 ** e) % N
*** Ciphertext: 7 41 54 100 151 34 140 119 93 93 ***
*** To decrypt ***
(7 ** d) % N
(41 ** d) % N
... etc ...
