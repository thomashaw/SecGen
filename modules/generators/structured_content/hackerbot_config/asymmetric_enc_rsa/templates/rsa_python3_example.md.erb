# An example of RSA using Python3









TODO: Convert the below into Log Book Questions

5.1 Task 1 - (10 pts)
Encryption/decryption techniques are methods that help with confusion and diffusion in a cryptosystem.
You may highlight on the mathematics behind the reviewed algorithms/cipher if you would like to do so;
however, this is not required unless necessary as part of your discussion/review.
A) The Security of RSA cryptosystem. (5 pts)
B) Diffie-Hellman algorithm and its security. (5 pts)


5.1.1 Requirements for Task 1
1. Provide a clear explanation of the reviewed cipher/algorithm (how it works).
2. Include illustrations, flow charts, digrams to underpin your arguments.
3. Critically evaluate the cipher/algorithm (strengths, weaknesses, efficiency, etc..).
4. Cryptanalysis techniques against the given cipher/algorithm.
