Welcome to SnipSnap
You can now login and add/edit your first post. There is a __post blog__ link
in the menu bar. For help with formatting your post take a look at
[snipsnap-help]. To create a link to a page on your site surround a word with
\[ and \]. Putting \_\_ around a phrase makes it __bold__ and putting \~\~
around it makes the phrase ~~italics~~. You can create links to the internet
by just writing the url like http://snipsnap.org or by using \{link:Name|url\}.
So \{link:SnipSnap|\http://snipsnap.org\} produces
{link:SnipSnap|http://snipsnap.org}. Have fun.

Pinging weblogs.com may be turned on. The
{link:FAQ|http://snipsnap.org/space/FAQ} explains how to turn this on or off.
