      A blog entry is typically something like a short article, piece of news, insight, abstract, opinion and so on. From a technical perspective, blog entries in Pebble are just short pieces of HTML that represent the content that you wish to display. This can be anything from a simple piece of text to an elaborate collection of text, images, tables, etc. In addition to this, Pebble stores other pieces of information alongside your blog entries such as a title, the date/time of publication and author.

      <h5>Adding a Blog Entry</h5>
      <img src="./images/blog-entries-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" />To add a new blog entry, choose <b>New Blog Entry...</b> from the <b>File</b> menu. In this popup window, just fill in the title and main body of the entry. When you've finished writing the entry, clicking the <b>Preview</b> tab will show you what your new entry will look like. If necessary, you can make further changes and preview them.
      </p>

      <p>
      When you're happy with the entry, click the <b>OK</b> button.

      The body of a blog entry is just a XHTML/HTML fragment, meaning that you can use any XHTML/HTML tags you like for markup and formatting. Common examples include using bold and italics. Also, you can include other elements such as hyperlinks and <a href="images.html">images</a>.

      For convenience when posting code and HTML fragments you can enclose these within &lt;escape&gt; and &lt;/escape&gt; tags. In doing so, any < or > characters will be automatically escaped to &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; respectively.
      </p>

      <p>
      <h5>Editing a Blog Entry</h5>
      Blog entries can be edited at any time after they have been posted. To edit an entry, double-click the appropriate blog entry in the main table. This opens the same window used to add a new entry, and you can again edit, preview and click <b>OK</b> when finished.
      </p>

      <p>
      <h5>Removing a Blog Entry</h5>
      Existing blog entries can also be removed at any time. To remove an entry, choose <b>Delete</b> from the <b>File</b> menu after highlighting the entry that you would like to delete. This will open a popup window asking you to confirm your action.
