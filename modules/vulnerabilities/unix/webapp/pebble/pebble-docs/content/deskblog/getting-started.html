        This section explains how to get started with Pebble deskblog.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Minimum Requirements</b>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html">Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) 1.4</a>
      </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Installation</b>
      <br /><br />
      Pebble deskblog doesn't need to be installed, just copy the <code>pebble-deskblog</code> directory from the Pebble distribution to a directory on your disk. For Mac OS X users, there is a specific Mac package that provides greater integration with the Dock.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Starting deskblog</b>
      <br /><br />
      To start deskblog, navigate to the directory on your disk containing deskblog and double-click on the <code>pebble-deskblog.jar</code> file. Alternatively, from the command line, type <code>java -jar pebble-deskblog.jar</code>. Mac OS X users can run the Mac OS X specific package.
      </p>

      <p>
      By default, deskblog stores all of the blog data in the <code>${user.home}/blog</code> directory. To change this, just provide an alternative path as an argument when starting deskblog. After the splash screen you will
      be presented with the main window as follows.
