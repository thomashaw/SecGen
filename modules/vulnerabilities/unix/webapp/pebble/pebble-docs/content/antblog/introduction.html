      <p>
        Pebble antblog is a set of custom Ant tasks that allow you to update a blog from within your Ant build script. For example, you might want to update a blog
        with the build status as a part of a continuous integration environment. A nice side-effect of posting such information to a blog
        is that you get an RSS feed from your blog (that developers can subscribe to) and the build status is archived in the same way blog entries are. Some blogs also provide a way to
        search over your blog entries, making it easy to find out how often the build failed! Antblog also includes a task that lets you upload
        build artifacts to your blog, via the MetaWeblog API.
