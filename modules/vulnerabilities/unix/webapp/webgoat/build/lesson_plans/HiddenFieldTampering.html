</div>
<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b> </p>

While this is a convienent and easy mechanism for the developer, they often don't validate the information
that is received from the hidden field.  This lesson will teach the attacker to find and modify hidden fields
to obtain a product for a price other than the price specified  <br>
<p><b>General Goal(s):</b> </p>
The user should be able to exploit a hidden field to obtain a product at an incorrect price.
