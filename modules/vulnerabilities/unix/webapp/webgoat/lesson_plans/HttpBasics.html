<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b> </p>
 This lesson presents the basics for understanding the transfer of data between
the browser and the web application.<br>
<br>
  Client Request: <br>
<br>
<div align="Left"> All HTTP transactions follow the same general format.
Each client request and server response has three parts:  the request or
response line, a header section, and the entity body. The client initiates
a transaction as follows: <br>
<br>
 The client contacts the server and sends a document request <br>
</div>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GET /index.html?param=value HTTP/1.0<br>
  <br>
 Next, the client sends optional header information to inform the server
of its configuration and the document formats it will accept.<br>
 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User-Agent: Mozilla/4.06 Accept: image/gif,
 image/jpeg, */* <br>
<br>
 After sending the request and headers, the client may send additional data.
This data is mostly used by CGI programs using the POST method.<br>
<br>
  Server Response:<br>
<br>
   Not relevant to this lesson.   
<p><b>General Goal(s):</b> </p>
 The user will become familiar with the features of the application and should
be able to manipulate WebGoat to  show the source html, source code, parameters,
and cookies.
