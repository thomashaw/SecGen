<p><b>Lesson Plan Title:</b> How to Perform Parameter Injection </p>
 </div>
 
<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b> </p>
Parameter&nbsp; injection attacks represent a serious threat to any parameter-driven
site. The methods behind an attack are easy to learn and the damage caused
can range from considerable to complete system compromise. Despite these
risks an incredible number of systems on the internet are susceptible to
this form of attack. <br>
<br>
 Not only is it a threat easily instigated, it is also a threat that, with 
a little common-sense and forethought, can be almost totally prevented. This 
lesson will show the student several examples of parameter injection.<br>
<br>
 It is always good practice to sanitize all input data, especially data that 
will used in OS command, scripts, and database queiries.<br>
<br>
 
<p><b>General Goal(s):</b> </p>
 The user should be able to execute any command on the hosting OS.
