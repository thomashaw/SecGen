<p><b>Lesson Plan Title:</b> How to Spoof an Authentication Cookie </p>
 </div>
 
<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b> </p>
Many applications will automatically log a user into their site if the right
authentication cookie is specified. &nbsp; Some times the cookie values can
be guessed if the algorithm for generating the cookie can be obtained. &nbsp;Some
times the cookies are left on the client machine and can be stolen by exploiting
another system vulnerability. &nbsp;Some times the cookies maybe intercepted
using Ccross site scripting. &nbsp;This lesson tries to make the student
aware of authentication cookies and presents the student with a way to defeat
the cookie authentication method in this lesson.<br>
 
<p><b>General Goal(s):</b> </p>
 The user should be able to bypass the authentication check.
