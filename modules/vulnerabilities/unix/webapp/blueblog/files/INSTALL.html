<h1>BlueBlog installation and configuration</h1>

<p>
<b>Congratulations on downloading BlueBlog weblog application!</b>
</p>

<p>
This document will get you ready to start blogging within minutes.
But first, we'll need to make sure you have the other components
needed by BlueBlog.
</p>

<h1>Necessary components</h1>

<p>
To get BlueBlog running in its simplest form, you will need to
have downloaded and installed a Java 2 Standard Environment
(version 1.4 or later) and a Servlet Engine like Jakarta Tomcat,
Resin, Jetty or other. This document will only cover working with
Tomcat. Please refer to the servlet engine documentation to install
BlueBlog with other servlet engines.
</p>

<p>
If you already have a recent J2SE and Tomcat up and running,
you can skip to the <a href="#addcontext">Add Context</a> section
below.
</p>

<h2>Download and install Jakarta Tomcat</h2>

<h1>Add a web application context for BlueBlog in Tomcat</h1>
</a>

<p>
Application contexts in Tomcat are defined in the <tt>server.xml</tt>
file located in the <tt>conf</tt> directory under the Jakarta Tomcat
root directory. Open this file in a text editor like Wordpad (in
Windows) or Emacs (in Unix/Linux). Find the first <tt>&lt;Context</tt>
element, inside of a <tt>&lt;Host</tt> element. You'll need to add
a new Context for BlueBlog, and you may want to remove any contexts
that are already there, especially if they have the same context path that
you want to use for BlueBlog. (For instance &ndash; by default Tomcat installs
an <tt>/examples</tt> context.)
</p>

<p>
Add a new Context for BlueBlog by adding this text:
</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;Context path="/blueblog" docBase="c:\blueblog\web" debug="1" reloadable="true"/>
</pre>

<p>
The entry above assumed that BlueBlog was installed in the c:\blueblog
directory. Change this entry to whereever you installed the files.
Also, the entry installed BlueBlog in the context path <tt>/blueblog</tt>.
You can change this to whatever suits you. If you want to install BlueBlog
as the default (or "root") context, leave the path attribute empty, like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;Context path="" docBase="c:\blueblog\web" debug="1" reloadable="true"/>
</pre>

<p>
If you don't have any other web applications installed on the same server,
the above is the recommended way of installing BlueBlog!
