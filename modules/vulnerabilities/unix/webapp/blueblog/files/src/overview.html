<h1>BlueBlog</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The BlueBlog weblog application is a pure Java/servlet
application with a flexible architecture and an easy setup.
(Sorry for the repetition, but there you go...)
</p>

<p>
Please see the <tt>INSTALL.html</tt> file in the root directory for
details on the installation procedure. This text will focus
on describing the technical architecture and design philosophy
of the BlueBlog application.
</p>

<h2>Overall architecture</h2>

<p>
You need to understand the roles of these main classes to "get"
the BlueBlog architecture:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>{@link se.bluefish.blueblog.repository.Repository}</b> &ndash;
represents a single person's weblogs, with
hierarchies of categories and blogs. A Repository instance also
represents a single, specific way of storing blogs. For example,
one Repository instance may take care of the user <b>robert</b>'s
weblogs, and store them in one directory in the filesystem, while
another Repository instance takes care of the user <b>peter</b>'s
weblogs, and stores them in a relational database.
</li>
<li>
<b>{@link se.bluefish.blueblog.blog.Category}</b> &ndash;
a named collection of blogs and sub-categories. Think of it
as a directory containing subdirectories (sub-categories) and
files (blogs). The difference is that when you ask it to give
you a list of Blogs (see {@link se.bluefish.blueblog.blog.Category#getRecentBlogs(int,boolean)})
you'll get blogs from both the current category, but also from
all sub-categories.
</li>
<li>
<b>{@link se.bluefish.blueblog.blog.Blog}</b> &ndash;
a single weblog entry. The most important properties are its
title and its contents.
</li>
<li>
<b>{@link se.bluefish.blueblog.repository.RepositoryManager}</b> &ndash;
Stepping up a bit, the RepositoryManager is responsible for
managing a set of Repositories, i.e. all the blogs for a set of
users. Concrete implementations of RepositoryManagers know about
how to store Blogs in a certain way (filesystem, database, etc)
and can take any user-defined parameters from the <tt>repositories.xml</tt>
configuration file.
</li>
<li>
<b>{@link se.bluefish.blueblog.repository.RepositoryFactory}</b> &ndash;
singleton object that reads the <tt>repositories.xml</tt> configuration
file and creates the appropriate RepositoryManagers, providing them with
parameters from the configuration file.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
An URL from the browser is divided in these components:
</p>

<p>
<b><tt style="color:black">http://server</tt><tt style="color:blue">/appcontext</tt><tt style="color:green">/bb</tt><tt style="color:red">/username</tt><tt style="color:brown">/category/subcategory</tt></b>
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<b><tt style="color:black">http://server</tt></b> &ndash;
Your server (domain name). Nothing out of the ordinary here.
</li>
<li>
<b><tt style="color:blue">/appcontext</tt></b> &ndash;
This is the name you give to the application context when you
install BlueBlog into your web app container. In Tomcat, for example,
this is the "<tt>path</tt>" attribute to the "<tt>Context</tt>"
element in the <tt>server.xml</tt> file. Note that you can install
BlueBlog as the "default context" or "root context", which means
that this part of the URL is empty. (In Tomcat you can do this
by giving the <tt>path</tt> attribute the value of <tt>""</tt>.)
</li>
<li>
<b><tt style="color:green">/bb</tt></b> &ndash;
This is the URL pattern matching this request to the
{@link se.bluefish.blueblog.servlet.BBServlet},
as specified in the <tt>web.xml</tt> file. You <i>can</i> change this,
but I don't see why you should.
</li>
<li>
<b><tt style="color:red">/username</tt></b> &ndash;
This is the part of the request URL that tells you whose (i.e. which
user's) blogs the reader is interested in. This has a one-to-one
mapping with a {@link se.bluefish.blueblog.repository.Repository},
so it can also be regarded as the address of a Repository.
</li>
<li>
<b><tt style="color:brown">/category/subcategory</tt></b> &ndash;
The last part of the URL points out which category (or sub-category,
any number of levels deep) we should read from. This part can
be left out altogether, meaning that we want to read the root category
(topmost category).
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The URL can also end with a few request parameters (separated form
the path part of the URL with a '?' character). These are handled by the
{@link se.bluefish.blueblog.servlet.BBServlet} like this:
</p>
