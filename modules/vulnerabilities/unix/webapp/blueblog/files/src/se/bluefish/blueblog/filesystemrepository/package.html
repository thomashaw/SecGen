Categories are represented as directories in the file system, 
Blogs are implemented as files (one file per Blog). 
Meta-information is stored in separate directories in each 
directory (named ".settings" by default).

The directory representing the root category is pointed out by
a parameter ("rootpattern") in the configuration file.
